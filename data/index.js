        answer: 'Lifting too much weight can be harmful for your lower back and back health rather than your baby. Therefore, you can lift heavy loads during pregnancy, provided that you do not push too hard.When lifting any weight, it will be appropriate for your back health to slightly bend your knees, take the weight right next to your feet, not in front of you, and keep your back as upright as possible.However, heavy lifting is not recommended for pregnant women at risk of miscarriage or premature birth.',

    {
        question: 'Is there any significance of bleeding gums when brushing teeth?',
        answer: 'During pregnancy, like other "mucous membranes" in the body, the gums develop "hypertrophy (tissue growth)" due to increased blood supply. As a result, the gums swell and the tendency to bleed increases with each brushing. In general, as long as pain and redness do not develop, there is nothing to worry about.Dental care is just as important during pregnancy as during the normal period. Tooth brushing (at least twice a day) should be done with soft-tipped toothbrushes and without putting too much pressure on the gums.In addition, cleaning between teeth and regular dental examinations are important. Cleaning the teeth prevents plaque formation. Failure to clean the teeth may exacerbate bleeding.',

    },
    {
        question: 'Can nosebleeds be due to pregnancy?',
        answer: "Just like bleeding gums, nosebleeds during pregnancy develop as a result of increased blood supply to the body's mucous membranes due to an increase in certain hormones secreted. Apart from being uncomfortable, this change is usually not harmful to you or your baby.",

        type: "Ultrasound"
    },
    {
        question: 'Are vaginal ultrasounds during pregnancy harmful to the baby or the pregnancy?',
        answer: 'One of the most common questions we are asked is whether vaginal ultrasounds during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, have a harmful effect on the baby or the pregnancy. Vaginal ultrasounds during pregnancy do not harm the baby or the pregnancy in any way and do not cause miscarriage.  On the contrary, vaginal ultrasounds, especially in the first trimester, give us important clues about the fetus (baby) and pregnancy.',

    },
    {
        question: 'Can pregnant women have their teeth extracted?',
        answer: 'Dental caries and dental disorders are more common during pregnancy than normal. This is because there is a constant calcium deficiency from teeth and bones during pregnancy. Therefore, a calcium-rich diet is of great importance.Surgical procedures such as tooth extraction, filling and root canal treatment should be postponed until after the first trimester unless it is very necessary. However, if it is very necessary, it can be done in the first months by taking some precautions.When you visit your dentist, be sure to tell him/her that you are pregnant and your gestational week.',
